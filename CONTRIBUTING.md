# 🤝 Contributing to the `agent://` Protocol

Thanks for your interest in contributing to the `agent://` protocol! This repository hosts the development and discussion of the [Internet-Draft](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-narvaneni-agent-uri/) proposing a URI-based framework for interoperable software agents.

We welcome feedback, discussion, and pull requests across all areas of the project — from the spec itself to reference implementations and ecosystem design.

## 🧭 Project Goals

The `agent://` protocol is part of a broader vision to enable:
- Interoperable, URI-addressable agents
- A layered protocol model: addressing → discovery → orchestration
- Composable and collaborative multi-agent systems across ecosystems

Let’s shape the future of agent-native computing together!
