# 🤝 Contributing to the `agent://` Protocol

Thanks for your interest in contributing to the `agent://` protocol! This repository hosts the development and discussion of the [Internet-Draft](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-narvaneni-agent-uri/) proposing a URI-based framework for interoperable software agents.

We welcome feedback, discussion, and pull requests across all areas of the project — from the spec itself to reference implementations and ecosystem design.

## 🔧 How to Contribute

1. **Fork this repository**
2. **Create a new branch** for your contribution
3. **Make your changes** (draft edits, implementation code, docs, etc.)
4. **Submit a pull request** with a clear description of what you’re proposing

For changes to the Internet-Draft:
- Edits should be made to the `docs/rfc/draft-narvaneni-agent-uri-00.md` file
- Use [`kramdown-rfc2629`](https://github.com/cabo/kramdown-rfc) to generate `.xml` file
- Use [`xml2rfc`](https://tools.ietf.org/tools/xml2rfc/) to regenerate `.txt` and `.html` if needed.
- Ensure that there are no warnings or errors from `kramdown-rfc2629` or `xml2rfc`
- We can help you with the tooling!

## 🔢 Version Management

### Single Source of Truth

The version is defined in **one place only**:

```python
# agent_uri/__init__.py
__version__ = "0.2.1"
```

### Version Update Process

When updating the version:

1. **Update `agent_uri/__init__.py`**:
   ```python
   __version__ = "x.y.z"
   ```

2. **Update `pyproject.toml`**:
   ```toml
   version = "x.y.z"  # Must match __init__.py
   ```

3. **That's it!** All other components will automatically use the correct version.

### How Components Get the Version

- **Submodules** (`common/`, `descriptor/`) import from main package
- **CLI** uses package metadata with fallback to imported version
- **Tests** should use flexible version checking, not hardcoded versions

### Testing Version Checks

```python
# ✅ Good - flexible version checking
assert "agent-uri" in result.stdout
assert any(char.isdigit() for char in result.stdout)

# ❌ Bad - hardcoded version
assert "agent-uri 0.2.1" in result.stdout
```

## 🧭 Project Goals

The `agent://` protocol is part of a broader vision to enable:
- Interoperable, URI-addressable agents
- A layered protocol model: addressing → discovery → orchestration
- Composable and collaborative multi-agent systems across ecosystems

Let’s shape the future of agent-native computing together!
